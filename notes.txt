PROJECT NAME - DOG RATER

DOGS WILL HAVE THEIR OWN CARDS. EACH CARD WILL HAVE A PHOTO, A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DOG, TWO BUTTONS (ONE SAYS GOOD DOG ONE SAYS BAD DOG), UNDER EACH BUTTON IT SAYS HOW MANY VOTES FOR GOOD OR BAD DOG. A COMMENT SECTION WILL BE AT THE BOTTOM. HERE IT HAS ALL PREVIOUS COMMENTS + A PLACE TO TYPE AND POST YOUR OWN COMMENT.

ADD YOUR DOG SECTION - AN INPUT FOR DOG IMAGE URL, DOG NAME, AND DOG DESCRIPTION. DOG UPLOADS TO PAGE ONCE SUBMITTED. SME TOOLS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR COMMENTS AND "GOOD OR BAD DOG" BUTTONS

DOGS WILL BE LOADED INTO A DB.JSON SERVER. I WILL USE ARRAY ITERATION TO PUT EACH ONE ONTO THE PAGE AS DOG CARDS.
