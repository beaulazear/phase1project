PHASE 1 PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

- MUST USE HTML/CSS/JS FRONT END 

- ACCESS API OR DB.JSON USING JSON-SERVER (NOT ONE THAT REQUIRES A KEY)

- API OR DB.JSON MUST RETURN 5 OBJECTS, EACH WITH THREE ATTRIBUTES

- ALL INTERACTIONS HANDLED ASYNCHRONOUSLY AND IN JSON COMMUNICATION FORMAT

- MUST BE ON ONE SINGLE PAGE ONLY

- USE AT LEAST THREE *UNIQUE* EVENT LISTENERS

- MUST USE AT LEAST ONE INSTANCE OF ARRAY ITERATION

- "STRETCH GOALS?" USE JSON-SERVER

PLANNING :

PROJECT - DOG SCHEDULER "WHOS BEING WALKED TODAY?"

THE APPLICATION WILL START WITH A SEARCH BAR AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE, ASKING YOU TO TYPE WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK YOU WOULD LIKE TO VIEW. ONCE SUBMITED, DOGS FROM MY LOCAL DATABASE THAT ARE SCHEDULED TO BE WALKED THAT DAY WILL APPEAR ON THE PAGE. EACH DOG WILL HAVE THEIR OWN CARD WITH A PHOTO, THEIR ADDRESS, THE TIME THEY NEED TO BE WALKED, + A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DOG (ANYTHING YOU MAY NEED TO KNOW FOR THE WALK) EACH CARD WILL HAVE ONE BUTTON AT THE BOTTOM THAT ALLOWS THE USER TO CANCEL THE WALK. THIS WILL DELETE THE CARD FROM THE SCREEN.

DOGS WILL BE LOADED INTO A DB.JSON SERVER. I WILL USE ARRAY ITERATION TO PUT EACH ONE ONTO THE PAGE AS DOG CARDS.

EVENT LISTENER #1 - 'CLICK' ON "CANCEL WALK" SECTION, GETS RID OF THAT DOG CARD.

EVENT LISTENER #2 - 'INPUT' TAKES USER INPUT AND USES THAT INFORMATION TO ITERATE THROUGH ARRAY AND DISPLAY APPROPRIATE DATA.

EVENT LISTENER #3 - 'ALERT' WHEN A DAY IS SELECTED, THE USER WILL BE NOTIFIED ON THE TOP OF THE PAGE "HERE IS YOUR SCHEDULE FOR ${CHOSEN DAY}"

THIS PROJECT WILL USE HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, AND JSON FILES. THIS PROJECT WILL HAVE AT LEAST THREE UNIQUE EVENTLISTENERS. THIS PROJECT WILL ITERATE THROUGH ARRAY. THIS PROJECT WILL USE A LOCAL JSON FILE AS A MOCK SERVER. WITH ALL THAT SAID, I BELIEVE THIS PROJECT WILL MEET ALL REQUIREMENTS :)

I EXPECT A FEW CHALLENGES ILL HAVE TO FACE. INCLUDING UNDERSTANING LOCAL JSON SERVERS IN RELATION TO FETCH. ALSO, CONNECTING THE DOTS AND GETTING ALL THE FILES TO WORK TOGETHER.
