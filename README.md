README
    
    This is an application to display which dogs are scheduled to be walked on a specific day. There is a select option with every day of the week (besides weekends, which I do not work). There is also an option for unscheduled dogs, which will display all the dogs that are in the database but not currently scheduled to be walked. All information is pulled from a local JSON database. Information includes days the dog is to be walked, timeframe they should be walked during, walk duration, their address, and a little bio with some information that may help on the walk.
